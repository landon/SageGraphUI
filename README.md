# SageGraphUI
[A canvas-based UI](https://landon.github.io/Playground/webgraphs/webgraphs.html) that allows for easy use of 
[Sage's graph theory functionality](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html).  This was originally made
as a test of using Bridge.NET to compile my C# graph theory software to JavaScript.
